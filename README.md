2. Install dependencies.
### `npm install`

3. In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
